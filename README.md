# CMPG323-Overview-30328608
CMPG323 Project 1 | Introduction to working with repositories


## Branching strategies
My branching strategy is trunk based development. The main idea behind this strategy is to make smaller changes more frequently and to limit merge conflicts.


## Project and Repository Structure
Each project will have its own repository. The overview repository will encompass links to the other project repositories.

## List of repositories
Links to other reposities created for other projects will be added to overview repository
Other repositories to be created may be: CMPG323 Project 2 30328308, CMPG323 Project 3 30328308, CMPG323 Project 4 30328308, CMPG323 Project 5 30328308, CMPG323 POE 30328308 

##Use of .gitignore file
An agile methodology approach is assumed for projects throughout the semester. Currently there is no use of gitignore files however updates will be made should a need arise for .gitignore files.

##Storage of credentials and sensitive info
Currently the project and repository are public with 3 additional accounts added as collaborators for marking purposes. Additional security measures will be implemented should need arise.
