##Use of .gitignore file
An agile methodology approach is assumed for projects throughout the semester. Currently there is no use of gitignore files however updates will be made should a need arise for .gitignore files.

##Storage of credentials and sensitive info
Currently the project and repository are public with 3 additional accounts added as collaborators for marking purposes. Additional security measures will be implemented should need arise.
